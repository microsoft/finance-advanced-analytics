The type of tech that changes not just how you get your job done, but what types of work you do day to day. Machines are getting better and better on more of the mundane tasks of our every day lives, and soon they will encroach on things we deem as hard or creative. This might seem like a scary future, where jobs are at stake and there is a zero sum game with machines taking all of the chips at the end of the day. The good news is the exact opposite will happen! New technology will open up new worlds of opportunity for people who know how to wield them correctly. They will become impact multipliers, allowing one person to have the impact of 100 people in less time. Types of new technology in corporate finance is sometimes referred to as ‚ÄúModern Finance‚Äù or ‚ÄúAdvanced Analytics‚Äù. These terms can sometimes mean the same thing, using new technology to reinvent current finance activities. Advanced Analytics still falls under the new technology description, but has more specific use cases. The biggest one is Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). This book will mostly talk about AI/ML and it‚Äôs potential for impact in corporate finance. The concept of building things with ML is a huge paradigm shift in who makes the rules in our world. Eventually, there will be two types of people in our society. Those who are at the mercy of machines run by ML, and those who control the machines. Historically the people who had the biggest impact in our world were architects/builders of some sort. People who rebuilt society for the better. In the United States they fell into a few buckets over the years. American Revolution: The Founding Fathers all had legal backgrounds. Knowing law enabled them to rethink how a nation should operate. They were able to use that knowledge to rewrite the rules and build one of the most prosperous nations in the world. Industrial Revolution: Knowledge of manufacturing and getting the best out of workers lead people like Andrew Carnegie and JP Morgan to amass some of the biggest fortunes ever seen, before antitrust came into play üòÅ. Other power brokers like Robert Moses were able to leverage more traditional architects to reinvent cities with sky scrapers and beautiful parks in New York City. Software/Internet Revolution: Coders in Silicon Valley were able to impact billions of people across the world with ideas written as code in computer programs. This resulted in the biggest leverage anyone in the world can have in terms of work-to-benefit ratio. Margaret Hamilton wrote code that put astronauts on the moon. Bill Gates and Paul Allen wrote the Windows operating system. Mark Zuckerberg wrote the initial version of Facebook in his college dorm room. There has never been a time in history where someone with an idea and a computer can single handedly change the world with such pace and impact. AI/ML Revolution: This is where we are at today. People who can wield the power of AI will have impact Bill Gates could only dream about back in the 80s. Teaching machines to learn on their own instead of specifically coding their instructions turns the traditional software model upside down, and opens up doors not thought possible. Self driving cars, cancer research, and world hunger are now problems closer to being solved with the help of AI. What took software teams of dozens of people to build can now be accomplished by one person with an algorithm and high quality data. If you‚Äôre reading this I hope you are recognizing the power of making machines and algorithms work for you, instead of the other way around. Learning how to do this may seem scary, so that‚Äôs why this book was written! You will have the opportunity to learn how AI and ML works in real life, and how you can develop the skills to thrive in the future AI workforce. Have a growth mindset, take the red pill, and dive down the AI rabbit hole. 1.2 Recommendation This book was built as way for people in finance to gain the skills needed to thrive in a future ruled by AI machines. While it would be great for everyone to learn how to build and run their own algorithms, this may not be the most feasible solution. The learning content provided starts at the highest level, then slowly goes deeper into the technical side. There are a couple of ways to leverage the content, called out below. Table Stakes: Everyone should know about the first principles of AI and ML. Eventually this knowledge will not be optional, but required. Knowing how AI works at a high level helps better understand ML systems your team might leverage in the future, and allows you to best leverage new tools that come out that make ML easier to use for everyone regardless of technical ability. Read the ‚ÄúNon-Technical Path: Machine Learning‚Äù sections to gain a fundamental understand of this new technology. Highly Recommended: Knowing basic data manipulation in addition to the core concepts of AI will catapult your career in more ways to count. Getting ‚Äúdata superpowers‚Äù by learning a little R or Python allows you to break out of the four walls of Excel that have been limiting you for too long. A whole new data world will become open to you, ripe with possibilities to drive impact in whatever job you have in Finance. This knowledge also helps lay the groundwork for building machine learning models, so it‚Äôs a nice stepping stone to more technical work. In addition to the ‚ÄúNon-Technical Path: Machine Learning‚Äù sections, read the chapters through ‚ÄúData Analysis and Manipulation‚Äù within the ‚ÄúTechnical Path: Machine Learning‚Äù sections. For the Architects of Tomorrow: For those who want to build exciting futures for everyone to benefit from, read every section! This will walk you through everything you need to know to have a successful data science career in Finance. Fortune favors the bold. The only question you need to answer is why not you? Have a growth mindset and get after it!

Paid courses, YouTube videos, blog posts, and books are all equally effective based on your learning style. The content in the following sections tries to have a healthy balance of all content types. By default, all of the recommended learning content is free. There are additional resources mentioned where you might have to pay for. These serve as additional avenues to strengthen the concepts and techniques learned in the initial free content. Machine Learning falls into two camps of programming languages, those who use R and those who leverage Python. Both have their strengths and weaknesses. All learning content will have an equal amount of resources for both R and Python. 3.1.2 R or Python? Short answer: Eventually you will have to learn both to become a successfully data practitioner, but if you could only pick one choose Python. 3.1.3 Getting the Most out of Learning Deliberate practice is the best way of getting the learning to stick, and to rapidly evolve your skills. Whenever you learn something new in the data and AI world, it‚Äôs best to usually apply it immediately to a real world project within your job or company. By using a real world problem to practice what you just learned, you‚Äôre able to reinforce the new knowledge into your long term memory while at the same time driving impact in your job by solving real problems. What a bonus! Be careful about only working on ‚Äútoy datasets‚Äù, which is public data that has been beat to death by hundreds of blogs and courses. The real world of data is messy and unpredictable, so working on things related to your current job or company gets you comfortable with that uncertainty even faster. Don‚Äôt feel bad looking up things on Bing/Google. Every technical person who works with computers today most likely looks up things online every day. Software syntax takes time to learn, and some of the best engineers still don‚Äôt remember all the ins and outs of a language. When it doubt look it up online! Sites like Stack Overflow will quickly become your best friend as you try to work through issues in your code. 3.2 Installing Software Getting started with the right developer environment can save tons of headaches further down the road. While there are many options on what type of Interactive Developer Environment‚Äôs (IDE) to use, the below ones are quickly becoming the standard for each language. 3.2.1 Python Coding Tools for Python Development VSCode Python Setup Install Packages - Windows Install Packages - Mac 3.2.2 R Installing R and RStudio Install Packages 3.3 Data Analysis and Manipulation Learning how to manipulate data outside of existing tools like Excel or Power BI quickly give you data super powers you never thought possible before. Breaking out of the four walls of excel and into the data universe by leveraging languages like Python and R unlock so much more potential for impact in whatever job you do. Even if you don‚Äôt plan to build your own Machine Learning models, knowing the basics of data manipulation is an important skill to have, and builds a data foundation that Machine Learning is built upon if you ever want to come back and start building models. 3.3.1 Python Pick one of the following Option 1 - Free Code Camp Option 2 - Zero to Pandas Option 3 - 12 Hour Course Exploratory Reports 3.3.2 R Basics of R Manipulating Data (skip ‚ÄúModel‚Äù chapter) Automating Excel in R Business Reporting in RMarkdown Exploratory Reports Fundamental of Data Visualization R Graphics Cookbook 3.3.3 Additional Resources Explore and Analyze Data in Python: Microsoft - Python Python for Data Analysis - Python Python for Excel - Python Data Cleaning Tutorial: Kaggle - Python Pandas Tutorial: Kaggle - Python Data Visualization Tutorial: Kaggle - Python Python Crash Course - Python Advancing Into Analytics - Python/R Python and R for the Modern Data Scientist - Python/R R Programming Tutorial: Learn the Basics of Statistical Computing - R Data Transformation Cheat Sheet - R R Basics: Harvard - R 3.4 Version Control If you plan to work with others on any project that contains code, knowing version control and specifically git is a must.

Prediction over time is a separate world in machine learning, and has deep roots in more classic statistical methods. While most regression models can be turned into a time series model by incorporating various date based features, there are also traditional statistical models that have been solely used for time series forecasting for decades. An interesting component of time series forecasting is that it can use multivariate data as well as univariate. For example you could forecast sales revenue by just using previous historical values of sales revenue (univariate) or use external regressor information like country holidays and population size to help forecast (multivariate). Knowing both types of models is a key component of being an expert time series practitioner. 3.7.1 High Level Topics Time Series Forecasting with Machine Learning Forecasting: Principles and Practice (Chapter 1) 3.7.2 Python Time Series Analysis in Python #1 Time Series Analysis in Python #2 Time Series Forecasting with XGBoost Introduction to Machine Learning with Time Series 3.7.3 R Forecasting: Principles and Practice Introduction to Modeltime: Forecasting with Tidymodels High Performance Time Series Forecasting Arima Forecasting in R Forecasting Multiple Time Series with Modeltime Plotting Time Series in R Microsoft Finance Time Series Forecast Framework 3.7.4 How Various Models Work All regression models in the Regression chapter can be turned into time series models Arima Exponential Smoothing 3.7.5 Additional Learning Resources Machine Learning for Time Series with Python - Python Practical Time Series Analysis - Python Time Series Forecasting: Business Science University - R 3.8 Classification Classification models try to forecast an outcome of an event. For example if a credit card transaction is fraud or if a self-driving car sees a stop sign next to the road. Usually the prediction outcome is a binary yes or no, and oftentimes a probability score between 0 and 1. With 1 having a 100% probability of something occurring. Classification models can even predict an outcome across multiple categories or buckets, like if a picture of a fruit is an apple, pear, orange, etc. Classification models are some of the most widely used machine learning across industries today. Within finance there are many important implementations that range from compliance to risk management. 3.8.1 High Level Topics Classification in Machine Learning (skip tutorial at end) Confusion Matrix Sensitivity and Specificity ROC and AUC 3.8.2 Python Train and Evaluation Classification Models: Microsoft Create and Understand Classification Models: Microsoft Confusion Matrix and Class Imbalance: Microsoft Measure and Optimize Model Performance: Microsoft Hyperparameter Tuning with Random Forest: Microsoft PyCaret Tutorials Titanic Tutorial Advertising Tutorial Loan Tutorial 3.8.3 R Logistic Regression Hotel Bookings Tutorial Water Source Availability Tutorial Beach Volleyball Tutorial Volcano Eruptions Tutorial Food Consumption Tutorial 3.8.4 How Various Models Work Logistic Regression K-Nearest Neighbors Decision Trees #1 Decision Trees #2 Random Forest Gradient Boost XGBoost 3.8.5 Additional Learning Resources Locally Weighted and Logistic Regression: Stanford Supervised Machine Learning: Coursera - Python Classification Bootcamp: Udemy - Python Machine Learning Classification: Coursera - Python 3.9 Unsupervised Learning Unsupervised learning is an evolving field of machine learning, and many say is the future of AI in general. Instead of relying on existing data with known outcomes to learn from like supervised learning (regression and classification), unsupervised learning tries to learn its own unique things about a data set without needing to know the answer ahead of time. This can be a game changer in finance when trying to segment customers into specific groups based on their purchasing behavior or finding anomolies to flag for potential fraud or corruption. 3.9.1 Python Train and Evaluate Clustering Models PyCaret Clustering Tutorial PyCaret Anomaly Detection Tutorial PCA Tutorial 3.9.2 R PCA Tutorial PCA and UMAP Tutorial Visualizing PCA in R 3.9.3 How Various Models Work K-Means Clustering PCA 3.10 Natural Language Processing Natural language processing (NLP) is all about extracting insight from unstructured data in the form of text.
